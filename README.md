Hashira Placements Assignment ‚Äì Polynomial from Roots

Problem Statement
We are given a JSON file containing roots of a polynomial, each root encoded in a different number system (base).  
The task is to:
1. Read the number of roots `n` and minimum required roots `k`.
2. Convert the first `k` roots into decimal.
3. Construct the polynomial of degree `k-1` using these roots.
4. Output the polynomial coefficients in descending powers of `x`.
